# CAPE baby steps stack testing repo
This repository contains testing stack definitions for the eventual CAPE 
architecture. The intent is to have a phased approach in a test stack (that may
contain sub-stacks) to test various aspects of the proposed CAPE architecture.

The file [baby-steps-cape-arch-rollout.md](baby-steps-cape-arch-rollout.md)
contains the proposed architecture phases. This file should be updated as needed
as the proposal changes.

The file [infra-development.md](infra-development.md) contains proposed 
development process type stuff for this project. At time of writing, **none of 
this has been agreed to.** Once it is we should codify it in that file (or 
another place that is not specific to a particular repo) and then point to it 
where necessary.

The file [baby-steps-costs.md](baby-steps-costs.md) contains an estimated cost 
breakdown. Currently this holds the phase 1 numbers. As things change, this 
should be updated, or a better method of tracking should be considered.
