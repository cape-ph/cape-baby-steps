Description: >
   Protected nested stack CloudFormation template. This is included in the 
   root cape-infra.yml root stack. 
   This template and other nested sub-stack templates are used to deploy an 
   example architecture to get some experience with these things under our 
   belts. In all templates, things we do not know yet that need to be filled in
   eventually are noted with `[TBD]`. Items that are commented out are either 
   not known or not needed. These will be cleaned up as we go.
